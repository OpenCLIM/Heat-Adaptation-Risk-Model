%   INPUT DATA
%   heat_impact_data.mat
%       
%   1.  Gridded population data {nClimScen}[nGridCells, 7]
%       Column 1&2 lat and long
%       column 3 {1} = Baseline 2011 
%       column 4-7 {1} = gridded poulation per age group
%       Columns 4-7 {2-5} = For 2020, 2030, 2050, 2080 UK from UDM (based
%       on UK-SSP projections.
%       NOTE: Only use total population for residential discomfort
%       calculations.
%
%   2. 12km gridded TMean daily data {nGridCells}(12, 14800). .csv files of 
%       daily TMean (one per grid cell) from HEAT model for baseline and warming levels 1.5째C
%       2.0째C, 3.0째C and 4.0째C
%
%       Grid coordinates also extracted from file names to provide grid ID for 
%       mapping based on lat_UK_RCM.mat and long_UK_RCM.mat.
%
%   3/4. lat_UK_RCM.mat and long_UK_RCM.mat: [82,112]. From Heat outputs, these are read 
%      in and provide latitude and longitude based on coordinate given in file 
%      names from 7 above. Saved in gridID.
%
%   5. deploymentPercent.(5,1). Percentage of total buildings where adaptation
%     (energy and shading retrofit) is installed. From UCL model. 
%     rows = 5 timeperiods (BL, 2020, 2030, 2050, 2080).
%
%   6. building_thresholds. {5,1}(2205, 11). TMean theresholds above which
%      residential discomfort would occur overnight in bedrooms. Based on UCL
%      model data. For 5 timeperiods (no data for 2080/2100 at present). Columns 1-2 lon and
%      lat, column 3 = GOR, column 4-7 = threholds for 4 building types with
%      NO adaptation; columns 8-11 = thresholds for 4 building types WITH
%      adaptation. Adaptation reflects energy retrofit and shading devices.
%
%   7. building_numbers. Total buildings per 12km gridcell for 4 building
%      types: Flats, detached, semi-detached, Terrace from UDM. Assumed
%      1.2ppl per dwelling in estimating future buildings based on density
%      of population.
%
%   8. building_name. String text for building names (in order) - for plots.
%      Flats, Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced
%

%   CURRENT MODEL OUTPUTS:
%   1. Intermediate results: ResultsExceedDays.
%   Average annual number of days that TMean thresholds are exceeded by 
%   building type. Note - these values are based only on TMean data and 
%   threshold data, and do not account for the population or number of 
%   dwellings.
%
%   2. Final result: ResultsAnnualFrequencyEvents
%   Impact-based definition. Average annual frequency of overheating events 
%   (can be classified as medium, severe or extreme) where residents facing 
%   discomfort from dwellings overheating.
