# Heat-Adaptation-Risk-Model
Heat Adaptation Risk Model (HARM) previously ARCADIA Impacts Model

Offline version of code and modified code which is available and runs on DAFNI. This version estimates heat and cold related mortality under future projections of climate change.

Updated from the ARCADIA Impacts model developed in the EPSRC ARCADIA project (ECI, University of Oxford) for OpenCLIM (Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, UEA).

Uses post-processed UKCP18 data provided from HEAT model - Daily TMean (Alan Kennedy-Asser, University of Bristol)

Additional inputs needed: heat_impact_data.mat (contains population, demongraphic, and basline mortality data)
                          lat_UK_RCM.mat and long_UK_RCM.mat (used to link gridded population, demographic and mortality data to gridded TMean data)
